Project Purpose

Database Bridge is an API library developed in Java, designed to simplify interaction with MySQL databases. The project aims to provide developers with an efficient and intuitive set of tools for performing common database operations, reducing complexity and the time required for implementation.

The primary goal is to offer an easy-to-use tool for developers working with MySQL databases. Through this library, the following objectives are pursued:

Simplifying Common Operations: Providing clear and concise methods for frequently used operations such as connecting to the database, executing SQL queries, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

Reducing Boilerplate Code: Eliminating the need to write repetitive and boilerplate code for basic operations, allowing developers to focus on the specific logic of their application.

Improving Productivity: Increasing the productivity of development teams by reducing the complexity of managing MySQL connections and transactions.

Flexibility and Extensibility: Offering a modular and extensible architecture that allows for the addition of extra functionalities based on project needs.

Supporting Best Practices: Encouraging the use of best practices in terms of security, error management, and performance optimization.
